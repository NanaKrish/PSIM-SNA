# PSIM
A pandemic simulator modeled using graphs to provide insights and provide for strategic situation handling using data driven metrics


- Person -> age and location(coordinates)
- Construct graph - with functions to update parameters
- Create infection function
- Tree growing algo - which invokes the infection function to determine the new spread(edge weights) spread
- Counter effective measures
- Infection spread and status
    - current status of healthy and infected
    - ETA for total infection
